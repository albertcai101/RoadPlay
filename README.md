I wanted to make an app that did 2 things: make the music more hype when you speed up and more mellow when you slow down. 
It can do this by means of varying volume and adding or removing different musical layers.

I learned that a song is a complex choreograph that takes skill to compose. The planning of the intricate ebb and flow, the timing, is necessary for a good song.
Without this aspect of timing, the music feels soul-less: too impatient or slow. Music depends on structure.
The listener enjoys the structure the artist imposes because the artist is talented in this choreography.

Syncing music with random driving actions removes all aspects of this choreographed timing. The musical structure breaks down and the music is no longer enjoyable.
The only potential I can see this working for is Lo-fi or jazz, where improvisation and a lack of structure are more prevalent.
